  1: GROUPING CSS SELECTORS
  wow, just wow. honestly, dissapointed in myself.
  so basically - the point of the lesson was to gorup
  css selectors using a comma, so that way that 
  selectors which share the same styling properties
  can be used without typing the css styling or adding
  an additional "shared" class for them.
  
  This made me think about CSS Tailwind which is
  basically what I was "reinventing" because that is
  basically just a huge list of class names applied to
  elements, with this super nice library of css class
  selectors to combine etc.
  
  So basically upon reflection of this, if the tailwind
  guy can get away with never grouping selectors, I dont
  need to beat myself up too bad here, but I see why
  people dont like tailwind and compare it to inline
  now.  Its basically like making the doc look like
  the coder never heard of grouping selectors before.
  Just bloats things honestly, although I do like the
  idea of library approach personally, it would def
  make it less readable no matter what some weird
  disciple of tailwind tries to spew at you lmao
  
  2: Regenerated a personal key no prob for the push
  honestly not that big of a deal. but idek seems a 
  little extra, probably some reason for this I dont
  understand.
  
  3: Using the pomodoro technique for ordering food
  then the next break for eating it is hacks lmao
  I been thinking about how tall people have a lower
  life-expectency, is that a thing. okay goodbye.-->
