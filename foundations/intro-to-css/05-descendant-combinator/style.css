/* Post project summary

Pretty easy one, because I was paying attention during the
lessons and already remembered off rip that descendant
combinators were just including a space, vs chained.

I understood the Both, Either, and within kind of concepts of
chaining, grouping, and descending respectively at this point

div p {
    background-color: yellow;
    color: red;
    font-size: 20px;
    text-align: center;
}

/* 
.container .text {

this should work too
}

div .text works too!! so you can combine classes
with normal elements thats pretty cool lol.
