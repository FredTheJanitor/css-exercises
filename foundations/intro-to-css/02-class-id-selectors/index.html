 <!-- Summary: Main things Learned
  1: SSH vs https pulls matters for ease of push
  with https I needed to create a key just to push my
  commits to the repo on github.  This is fine, and I
  feel like I learned some git stuff which is good.

  However, it does make it seem like the obvious path
  of least resistance would be downloading repos with
  ssh instead of https method. I read a little bit on
  reddit about the topic.

  2: MULTIPLE CLASSES ARE NOT LISTED WITH THE CLASS
  ATTRIBUTE EACH TIME IN THE HTML ELEMENT.
  
  This one drove me nuts, literally had to chatGPT why
  the fuck my shit isnt working because damn.  basically
  I was saying class="foo" class="bar" instead of
  class="foo bar" so it was only reading the first class
  so I was like wtf, but yeah.
