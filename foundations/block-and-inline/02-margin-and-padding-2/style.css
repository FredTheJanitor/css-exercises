/* after lesson discrepency:
padding on sides and bottom of card is doubled
*/

/* after lesson fix:
changed margins in first two sections to margin-bottom
ended up deleting button container margin completely
as it was doubling bottom margin unneccesarily.
*/

/* After Lesson Summary::after
I worked pretty quickly through this one and overlooked
some margins that were obviously different.

I also am realizing now that in these specific exercises
it may make more sense to make changes beneath the given
code under a comment to make them more readable.  not like
duplicated, but like as the 2nd half of the card if im 
adding whole new property/value pairs

I also learned that font-size: medium is 16ish! lol
