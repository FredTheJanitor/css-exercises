/* After Lesson Summary:
margin-left: auto right aligns an element.
I originally had margin-left: 335 px to
align it after a bunch of trial and error.

I realized after reading the self check
that it wanted me to "right-align" it not
just add margin, so I tried margin-right: 0px
but that didnt work and I got confused.

I saw on the internet that margin-left: auto;
mrgin-right: 0px; worked and assumed that it
was ignoring my margin-right due to it requiring
a margin-left value first, and this isnt really
true.

I think the real reason margin-right didnt work
is because of the "top-left" corner vibe of how
web-pages work.  Since there is no "bottom-right"
corner to push against, since this is the last
element in the index in the body, margin-right
isnt possible really.  

After checking the solution and seeing margin-left: auto
it really made me question my initial assumptions
since I dont even need the 0px for the margin-right
so thats what drove me to check with chatgpt and
stack overflow for some more insight on why.
